<h1>Election in India</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\Devil\Documents\Eclipse\VoterId\Images\poster.png" width="600" height="600" >
<p> In Democratic India, general elections take place every five years. All those who are eighteen years of age have a right to vote. A number of candidates seek election. They move from door to door. They hold public meetings and explain the programs of their parties. If they get majority of votes, they win; but if they do not, they lose. An election, therefore, is like a battle. But this battle is fought in a peaceful way. It is a battle of ballots, not a battle of bullets.

But in one sense an election is a kind of examination. Good students prepare hard for their examinations. Those who work hard get good marks. But those who never care for their books, fail. This is true of elections, too. There are good and honest leaders. They care for the welfare of the people. They never forget their voters. So, they get elected without much difficulty.

But there are also those who never care for these voters. Their only business is to earn as much as possible. They take bribe and help black-marketers. They never say ‘no’ to their voters but they never fulfill any promise. They remember their promises and their voters only when another election knocks at the door. Such leaders are like playful boys. Bad boys care for their examination only when it comes too near. How nervous they feel, then! They labor day and night for a month. But still they fail.</p>

<h1>Importance of Voting</h1>

<p>An examination, however, is not always a true test of merit. This is true of elections as well. Even bad persons very often win and good persons lose, why? Our voters do not know the importance of vote. A ballot paper we know is not just a piece of paper. It is a very powerful weapon. It changes a government without shedding even a drop of blood. But do the people always make a right use of their ballot paper? No, not always. They vote for a candidate in the name of some group or caste. Their poverty, too, does not allow them to use their vote well. How can poor people remain honest and not be bribed? So, our elections are neither completely free nor fair.</p>

<h1>Right to Information Act</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\Devil\Documents\Eclipse\VoterId\Images\right.jpg" width="400" height="200" >
<p>The Right to Information Act (RTI) is an Act of the Parliament of India "to provide for setting out the practical regime of right to information for citizens" and replaces the erstwhile Freedom of information Act, 2002. The Act applies to all States and Union Territories of India except Jammu & Kashmir. Under the provisions of the Act, any citizen may request information from a "public authority" (a body of Government or "instrumentality of State") which is required to reply expeditiously or within thirty days. The Act also requires every public authority to computerise their records for wide dissemination and to proactively certain categories of information so that the citizens need minimum recourse to request for information formally. This law was passed by Parliament on 15 June 2005 and came fully into force on 13 October 2005. Information disclosure in India was restricted by the Official Secrets Act 1923 and various other special laws, which the new RTI Act relaxes.The establishment of a national-level law, however, proved to be a difficult task. The Central Government appointed a working group under H. D. Shourie and assigned it the task of drafting legislation. The Shourie draft, was the basis for the Freedom of Information Bill, 2000 which eventually became law under the Freedom of Information Act, 2002. This Act was severely criticised for permitting too many exemptions, not only under the standard grounds of national security and sovereignty, but also for requests that would involve "disproportionate diversion of the resources of a public authority". There was no upper limit on the charges that could be levied. There were no penalties for not complying with a request for information. This Act, consequently, never came into effective force. </p>
